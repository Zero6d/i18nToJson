## This extension will convert current active tab and turn into json for you to copy translate text into it

## run command i18nToJson for the first time you will get prompt to select folder contain your translation json

## you also need to name it because if you already have the file you can name it that file

## the next time you use you wont have to do anything above again

**Enjoy!**
